Personal Portfolio Webpage - Responsive:

This is a Personal Portfolio webpage developed using jquery, Bootstrap, HTML5 and CSS3. It is completely Responsive with different design layouts
suitable for all mobile views and for tablets.

User Story:

1.	I can access all of the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.

2.	I can click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.

3.	I can see thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built and it should direct me to their respective codepen
	projects
	
4.	I navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

Above are the primary user stories. I added many other small features. Such as thumbnail images of the projects get zoomed and turn dark
in color when mouse hover.
100% Responsive. 
Also, on scroll page, the respective nav link gets active on whichever section you're on.

Several other features are present too.
Hope, you'll like it. :)
